# pass

Pass is a simple password manager that works on the terminal.

# WARNING

Since this is still early development, the store format will probably change in the future.

# Dependencies

- gnupg
- basher (for listing commands)

# Installation

### Using [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher)

```
$ basher install juanibiapina/pass
```

### Manual

Clone the repository and add the `bin` folder to your PATH

# Local usage

1. Initialize the store:

  ```sh
  $ pass init
  ```

2. Generate a key pair for this device

  ```sh
  $ pass gen-key
  ```

  This will create a public key file on the current directory.

3. Add the public key to the store

  ```sh
  $ pass add-device <hostname_key.gpg>
  ```

  Where \<hostname_key.gpg\> is the public key generated on the previous step.

4. Add a password:

  ```sh
  $ pass add site.com
  ```

5. Retrieve a password:

  ```sh
  $ pass read site.com
  ```
